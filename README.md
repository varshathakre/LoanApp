Mini Loan App
Welcome to the Mini Loan App! This application provides a platform for managing loans for both administrators and clients.

About the Application
The Mini Loan App offers a seamless experience for users to register, request loans with customized terms, and manage their repayments. Administrators have the authority to review loan requests, approve or reject them, and monitor the overall loan portfolio.

User Registration and Loan Request
Users can easily register on the platform by providing necessary details. Once registered, they can submit loan requests specifying the desired loan amount and repayment terms. The application allows users to customize repayment schedules based on their financial preferences.

Loan Approval Process
Loan requests are processed by administrators who review the user's information. Administrators have the discretion to approve or reject loan requests based on predefined criteria such as creditworthiness and risk assessment.

Repayment Management
Upon approval, users are notified, and they can start making weekly payments towards their loans. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing repayments, tracking payment history.

Additional Loan Requests
Users have the flexibility to request additional loan amounts if needed. Whether it's for unexpected expenses or personal investments, users can submit new loan requests..
